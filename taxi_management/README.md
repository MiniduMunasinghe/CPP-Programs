This C++ project models a Taxi Management System. It uses a `Taxi` class to encapsulate details such as taxi ID, driver name, rate per kilometer, and distance traveled. The project features methods to set and display taxi details, as well as to calculate the total bill for each trip. This demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts and file handling in C++.
