This C++ program implements a simple guest billing system for a hotel, allowing you to manage and calculate the bills of multiple guests. It defines a Guest class that stores the guest's ID, name, rate per day, and the number of days they stayed. The program allows for setting and displaying guest details, as well as calculating the total bill based on the rate per day and duration of stay. It provides a practical example of using classes, member functions, and basic C++ features like string handling and input/output operations.
